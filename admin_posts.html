                </p>
                <p>
                  Due to downtime and other factors, Support received 4,151
                  tickets in September, around double their usual monthly count.
                  They ask for your patience as they work through the high
                  volume of tickets.

                  per tag wrangler. They also finished their last recruitment
                  round of the year and began inducting their latest batch of

                  <strong>Legal</strong> has responded to a number of user
                  queries this month, including queries about YouTube

                  In order to make AO3's rules clearer to our users, we intend
                  to update the AO3 Terms of Service (TOS) in mid-November 2024.
                  Once this occurs, all users will need to agree to the updated
                  TOS to continue using AO3. The full text has been posted for
                  public review, as well as a detailed explanation of what has
                  (and hasn't) changed:

                <h3>Summary of changes</h3>
                <p>
                  As part of reorganizing the TOS for better clarity, the new
                  TOS is structured differently than the old one. A detailed
                  explanation of what was changed and why is available in the
                  <a
                    href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/58283857"

                    >update guide</a
                  >. These are the highlights:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    We've clarified the Content Policy, but we haven't changed
                    what works are or are not allowed.
                    <strong
                      >If your fanwork was allowed on AO3 before, then it is
                      still allowed.</strong
                    >
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    The TOS has been split into three pages (General Principles,
                    Content Policy, and Privacy Policy). This should make it
                    easier to find what you're looking for when you want to know
                    about a specific part of the TOS.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    We've simplified the language throughout the TOS and removed
                    redundant or overly specific phrases and passages. When
                    longer explanations would help to provide clarity, we've
                    added new questions to the TOS FAQ instead.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    We've updated the descriptions of how we and our
                    subprocessors collect and process user information
                    (including personal information) in the Privacy Policy.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    The Abuse Policy has been generalized to provide the AO3
                    Policy &amp; Abuse committee with greater flexibility to
                    determine how to address TOS violations, while still
                    providing protections for fanworks in accordance with AO3's
                    mission.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    The "Underage" Archive Warning, which is used for works that
                    depict or describe underage sex, is being renamed to
                    "Underage Sex". This does not change the meaning of this
                    warning or how it is enforced. When the TOS update occurs,
                    <strong
                      >all works with the "Underage" Archive Warning will be
                      recategorized automatically to display the new "Underage
                      Sex" Archive Warning label instead.</strong
                    >
                    If you have a work that carries the "Underage" warning and
                    you don't want it to display the "Underage Sex" label, you
                    can replace it with the "Creator Chose Not to Use Archive
                    Warnings" label at any time.
                  </li>
                </ul>

                  organization) will vote on the proposed changes to the Terms
                  of Service. If the Board votes in favor, the

                  The AO3 Fanzine Scan Hosting Project (FSHP) is a partnership
                  between the Open Doors committee and
                  <a href="https://zinedom.org" rel="nofollow"
                    >fan-run preservation project Zinedom</a
                  >
                  through which fanfiction and fanart originally published in
                  print fanzines is imported to the Archive of Our Own. Fanworks
                  can be imported to AO3 with the consent of either the creators
                  of the works or the publisher of the fanzine in which the
                  fanworks were published.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Today, Open Doors is pleased to announce a list of collections
                  that it has created since September 2023 to house fanworks
                  imported through the FSHP. A collection has been created for
                  each fanzine from which one or more fanworks have been
                  imported, but these collections do <em>not</em> contain every
                  work from each of these zines, and many so far only include
                  one work each in cases where Open Doors only has permission to
                  import that particular work. For full transparency, Open Doors
                  plans to continue to announce collections as they are created
                  that may or may not grow with additional fanworks as
                  additional permissions are obtained from more creators in the

                  My volunteer work fits into three closely-related bins. As a
                  tag wrangler, I connect users' character, relationship, and
                  freeform tags to our canonical tags, and I make new canonical
                  tags as needed. I wrangle about 70 fandoms, mostly historical
                  and SFF book and TV fandoms, with a few video games and RPF
                  fandoms thrown in there.
                </p>
                <p>
                  As a tag wrangling supervisor, I do all sorts of
                  administrative and management tasks related to wrangling. For
                  example, I help manage all phases of wrangler recruitment and
                  training: I evaluate applications, send out acceptances,
                  monitor training progress, and set up training schedules.
                  Sometimes I mentor new wranglers or new supervisors, and there
                  are always random administrative tasks to do.
                </p>
                <p>
                  As a Tag Wrangling/Support Liaison, I ferry user requests for
                  tags to be canonized or re-wrangled to the wranglers of those
                  fandoms, and I answer user questions about wrangling
                  guidelines and processes. (If you ask Support why a search on
                  Trans Danny Fenton returns a few Hawaii Five-O works, or how
                  to find works with a particular AU Sans when they are all
                  merged to Sans (Undertale), I'm probably the person who will
                  answer.) There’s a lot about wrangling that isn’t obvious
                  until you see it from the inside, but I like answering user
                  questions because if users understand the process better,
                  they’re more likely to tag in ways that will accomplish what
                  they want.

                  I have a very flexible schedule and a lot of free time, and
                  I'm online a ridiculous amount of that free time! I find
                  wrangling very relaxing, especially when it's easy - synning
                  misspelled character names to the canonical tags, making
                  relationship tags for characters that already have character
                  tags, and other things that don't need research or a lot of
                  thought - so I like to wrangle for a while before tackling
                  real life things I don't like doing, like taxes or phoning for
                  appointments or vacuuming, or even before writing fic or doing
                  other things that require more brainpower.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Supervisor tasks require a bit more attention, so I like to do
                  them when I have enough free time that I can concentrate on
                  them. Of course I always warm up with a little easy wrangling!
                </p>
                <p>
                  Most of the Support tasks I take on require coordination with
                  other wranglers, and Support requires communication with users
                  to be beta-read by another volunteer before sending out, so I
                  tend to do these in batches as well when I have a block of
                  time. We have a lot of older wrangling-related tickets that
                  have not yet been handled because there was too much work and
                  not enough liaisons, so whenever I feel particularly motivated
                  I try to answer the people who have probably given up on
                  getting answers.

                  I'm old :-) and have been in mainstream science fiction and
                  fantasy fandom for a very long time, although I didn't get
                  into fanfiction-type fandom until 2002. (Which I realize is
                  probably before many of the people reading this were born!) I
                  get super enthusiastic about my hobbies and like to help
                  organize things, so for example in 2002 and 2003, when fandom
                  was mostly on mailing lists and fandom-specific forum sites, I
                  coordinated an effort to help get fandom going on LiveJournal
                  by collecting invite codes, which were required at the time,
                  and distributing them to fanfiction writers and fanartists. I
                  used to edit various fandom newsletter communities, back when
                  that was a thing, too. Anyway, a fandom friend who was a
                  wrangler encouraged me to apply during a recruitment, and that
                  was all it took! When I became a supervisor, one of the tasks
                  I enjoyed the most was helping out with support tickets, so
                  when I got the chance to be a Support Liaison I immediately
                  said yes please!

                  As I mentioned, I'm old, and I started out on mailing lists
                  where tags were fandom, characters, and pairing, and that was
                  it. I never managed to get into Tumblr, which I suspect is
                  where the use of descriptive tags started. Often I look at
                  freeform tags that reference memes, or Gen Z slang, or newer
                  terms for sexual identity, and I am completely baffled!
                  Fortunately, the wrangler chat is a wonderful research source,
                  and other wranglers are always kind about helping this little
                  old lady <s>across the street</s> decipher tags.

                <p>
                  I write and read fic, although not so much these days as way
                  back when. (But I still get a smile on my face when my old
                  works get kudos or comments!) I used to vid a little, too, but
                  even though I haven't participated in Festivids for many
                  years, I still enjoy watching the vids people create for small
                  fandoms, and recommending the ones I love best. I also really
                  like to beta read fic, because that way I can help good
                  stories become great stories.
                </p>
                <p>
                  But my most intensive fannish involvement these days is being
                  a fanwork exchange moderator. I moderated a number of small
                  single-fandom exchanges pre-AO3, and wow, AO3 makes it so much
                  easier. I love small fandoms, and I participated in Yuletide
                  nearly from the beginning, so I was super excited to be
                  invited to become part of the moderation team some years back.
                  I also co-mod the current incarnation of the Worldbuilding
                  Exchange, and sometimes I help out with other exchanges.

                  The Organization for Transformative Works's October membership
                  drive is over and we are delighted to say that we are
                  finishing with a total of $214,698.86 raised. We are
                  particularly pleased that 6020 donors chose to either take up
                  or renew OTW membership with their donation, far exceeding our
                  goal of 4,500 members.
                </p>
                <p>
                  These donations came from 6,955 people in 86 countries: thank
                  you to every single one of you, as well as to all of you who
                  posted and shared the news about the drive! The OTW would not
                  exist without its users all around the world, and your
                  continued support for us is our absolute pride and joy! We are
                  so glad to know that our ongoing mission to support, protect,
                  and provide access to the history of fanworks and fan culture
                  continues to resonate with the people that matter most of all:
                  the fans themselves.
                </p>

                  Do you remember that one fanfic that kept you reading until
                  dawn for the very first time? Or the fan art or video that led
                  you to dig out all the works its creator shared? Have you ever
                  tried to look into the stories of the authors who wrote fics
                  before you were even born? You can find all this and more on

                  Fanlore is a project run by the Organization for
                  Transformative Works (OTW) with the goal of providing fans a
                  place to record and share their histories, experiences and
                  traditions. Fanlore records both the history and current state
                  of our fan communities – fan works, fan activities, fan
                  terminology, individual fans and fannish-related events. You
                  can read about what fandoms were like in the olden days and
                  document memorable events in your own fandoms, all on Fanlore!

                  We would not be able to preserve these cherished pieces of

                  keep all our projects running. As always, we have some shiny

                  our new thank-you gifts. For a US$40 donation, we have a new

                    Thanks to your generosity in previous years, we have a
                    healthy amount of money in our reserves, which we can use to
                    pay for larger than usual purchases and keep on hand for
                    legal contingencies. As mentioned previously, we plan to
                    continue to upgrade the capacity of the Archive's servers,
                    which significantly increases server equipment and server
                    hosting expenses. As the Archive and other projects of the
                    OTW grow, we also spend more on tools and technology to
                    support our volunteers, such as the tools used by various
                    committees to communicate with and aid users and to track
                    internal projects, further increasing expenses.

                  From May to September, we had quite the exciting set of
                  releases! Most notably, we made a lot of improvements to the
                  admin area of the Archive, enabled comment moderation on news
                  posts, and added official labels to accounts held by AO3
                  committees. We also prepared for an upgrade to our search
                  servers, and integrated a new server monitoring system after
                  our old contract ended.

                <p>
                  We tried deploying a handful of bug fixes and things to finish
                  up the Rails 7 upgrade on September 19th (in release 0.9.376).
                  Alas, the Rails-related changes had some pretty negative
                  impacts on users’ ability to stay logged in, so we reverted
                  the same day (in release 0.9.377). The remaining bug fixes
                  went out on September 26th, once we made sure the dangerous
                  stuff was fully reverted.

                    subscribed to, that didn’t clean everything up, causing a
